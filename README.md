# knitld

knitld or knit in short is a MachO linker designed to be small and is able to use cross-platform.
knit is made as an educational project on Apple's MachO binary file format just before my highschool
spring semester ends.

The knit codebase tries to be as concise and well-documented as possible to not leave redundant 
code to reduce readability and maintainability. It is also noteworth to mention that this project
serves as a prototype for a newer version that implements concurrent linking.
